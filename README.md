🌳 Tree Detection and Segmentation Pipeline (DINO + ViT + SAM + YOLO+)

A modern deep learning project combining the power of vision transformers and segment-anything models to accurately detect and isolate trees in complex scenes using advanced filtering and evaluation techniques.

📌 Key Components

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| DINO | Vision Transformer-based object detection |
| ViT  | Backbone feature extraction |
| SAM  | Smart segmentation with mask refinement |
| YOLO+ | Real-time object detection |

---

- ✅ Refined Segmentation Masks: Removed irrelevant masks (e.g., humans, background) generated by SAM.
- ✅ Post-processing Isolation: Only tree-like objects are segmented with minimal overhead.
- ✅ Mask Filtering: Shape and size-based filtering improves mask quality.
- ✅ Evaluation Support: Built-in performance evaluation using:
  - IoU (Intersection over Union)
  - Precision & Recall
  - AP (Average Precision)

🚀 Quick Start

Requirements

bash
pip install jupyter


Inference

bash
jupyter nbconvert --to script Sam_Filtered_ViT_Segmentation.ipynb
python sam_filtered_vit_segmentation.py --image Images/Trees/Tree.jpg


Options

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| --model | Choose model: dino, yolo+, sam |
| --evaluate | Run evaluation metrics |
| --refine | Apply shape/size mask filtering |

---

📊 Evaluation

We evaluate performance using:

- IoU - Measures overlap of predicted vs ground truth
- Precision / Recall - Accuracy of segmentation results
- AP - Average precision across confidence thresholds

Results are printed and logged automatically.

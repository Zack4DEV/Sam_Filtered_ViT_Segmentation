### Scope

AI Test Kitchen offers 3 tools: **ImageFX**, **MusicFX**, and **TextFX**. Users in launched countries can try out generative AI technology firsthand. However, this technology comes with its own challenges since the responses can be inaccurate or inappropriate. Google addresses this by adding layers of protection to minimize these risks, with the goal of eliminating them over time.

### How to Register

**VideoFX** is currently available only to selected trusted testers in the US. **MusicFX** and **TextFX** are available in supported countries where users can evaluate models that may understand prompts in other languages. However, the quality of the generated output may vary depending on the language and complexity of the prompt.
